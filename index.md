# Education

<div style="text-align: justify"> <p>I received a PhD in applied mathematics at the University of Leeds in November 2022. I worked under the supervision of Dr Vincent Caudrelier in the Integrable Systems group.</p>

<p>I also hold a BSc and an MSc in mathematics from the University of Kinshasa and the University of the Western Cape, respectively.</p>
</div>

# Research interests

<div style="text-align: justify"> <p>I am interested in the area of Mathematical Physics, known as Integrable Systems. In particular, I study initial-value problems and initial-boundary value problems for the class integrable nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). This class contains some of the well-known models in Mathematical Physics, such as the nonlinear Schrödinger equation, Korteweg-de Vries equation and Sine-Gordon equation. </p>

<p>These equations share an interesting feature: they all admit soliton solutions. Solitons are solutions that behave like particles and waves; they arise in many physical systems, such as internal water waves and nonlinear optics. Solitons have attracted scientists's attention in the last 60 years due to their stability. Another feature that integrable nonlinear PDEs have in common is that they are obtained in terms of systems of ordinary differential equations known as Lax pairs. The spectral analysis of these Lax pairs gives rise to the powerful inverse scattering transform (IST). The IST is used to analyse initial-value problems (IVPs) for integrable nonlinear PDEs. A characteristic of the IST method is that it provides a framework to construct soliton solutions following a finite number of steps. It has been named inverse scattering transform due to its multiple similarities with the Fourier transform, which is used to analyse IVPs for linear PDEs.</p>
